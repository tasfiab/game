Old lady: hello deary...
Old lady: back in my day, we only had bread to keep us alive
Old lady: simple, sturdy bread
Old lady: now I see too much
Old lady: too many ingredients - I can't keep up!
Old lady: if you may, I want something nostalgic...
Old lady: though a strawberry touch sounds delightful!
